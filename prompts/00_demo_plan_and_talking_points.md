# Demo Plan & Talking Points

*For Presenter Use Only — Not for Coding Agent or Audience*

---

## Objective

Guide you, the presenter, through a smooth, engaging, and approachable demo of building a general-purpose, agentic credit analysis tool. The CoreWeave analysis is used as a sample case study, but the main focus is on showing how to build a similar tool for any public company. This plan is designed for an audience of bankers and underwriters, most of whom have no coding background.

---

## Opening: Setting the Stage

- **Introduce yourself and the session:**
  - "Hi everyone, today I’m going to show you how we can use modern AI to automate and streamline credit analysis for any public company."
  - "Don’t worry if you’re not technical — I’ll keep things simple and walk you through every step."
- **What they’ll see:**
  - "We’ll go from entering a company name, to seeing a full credit analysis, to viewing it as a modern, interactive website — all in real time."

## Step-by-Step Demo Plan

### 1. Show the Files & Explain the Flow
- Show the project folder and highlight the three main prompt files:
  1. **01_intro_and_context.md** — Sets the stage and explains what we’re doing
  2. **02_generate_credit_analysis.md** — The instructions for the AI to create a credit analysis
  3. **03_build_website_from_analysis.md** — How we turn the analysis into a website
- "Each file is like a recipe card — clear, simple, and designed for both you and the AI to follow."

### 2. Step 1: Set the Context
- Open **01_intro_and_context.md**.
- Read or paraphrase the first section for the audience:
  - "We’re going to use AI to generate a credit analysis for any public company, then turn it into an easy-to-navigate website."
  - "The process is modular, so each step is clear and repeatable."
- Point out the simple workflow diagram if present.

### 3. Step 2: Generate the Credit Analysis
- Open **02_generate_credit_analysis.md**.
- "This is the prompt we give to the AI. It’s written in plain English — you don’t need to know any code."
- Copy and paste the prompt into the coding agent (e.g., ChatGPT, Cascade).
- Narrate what’s happening:
  - "The AI is now writing a full credit analysis, section by section, just like a human would."
- If the output isn’t perfect, reassure the audience:
  - "Sometimes the AI needs a little nudge or clarification, just like a junior analyst."

### 4. Step 3: Build the Website
- Open **03_build_website_from_analysis.md**.
- "Now we’ll use this simple set of instructions to turn the analysis into a website."
- Paste the instructions into the coding agent.
- Narrate:
  - "The AI is now building a website that makes the analysis easy to read and navigate."
- Start the local server and show the live preview.

### 5. Review & Troubleshoot
- "If anything goes wrong, I’ll walk you through how I’d fix it — transparency is key!"
- Use the troubleshooting tips in the README and prompt files.

## Demo Sequence (2025-05-03 UX Update)

1. **Start at the Title Slide:**
   - "We’ll begin at the Moody’s-style title slide, which sets the stage for the demo. I’ll click ‘Start Demo’ to reveal the sample report."
2. **Show the Sample Report (CoreWeave):**
   - "Here’s a real example of a credit assessment generated by our Credit Assessment AI Agent."
3. **Transition to Generalization:**
   - "If you’re wondering how you could do this for any company, there’s a button right here: ‘How can I build this for any company?’ Let’s click it."
4. **Agentic Process Modal:**
   - "This opens a dialog that explains the agentic process, step by step — from ingesting data, analyzing financials, generating visuals, composing the narrative, to reviewing and exporting the final report."
   - "In a future version, this could be a live or simulated agentic build — for now, it’s a clear roadmap of how the agent works."
5. **(Optional/Planned) Agentic Build Sequence:**
   - "In future demos, we’ll make this interactive, so you can actually watch the agent build a new report for any company, step by step."

**Button/Label Reminders:**
- Narrate actual button labels as you click them: ‘Start Demo’, ‘How can I build this for any company?’, ‘Launch Credit Assessment AI Agent’.

## Fallback Demo Instructions

- If the live demo or server is unavailable, open `samples/coreweave/index.html` in any browser.
- All dependencies are included; no server or coding required.
- Use this to illustrate the intended user experience and design.

## Troubleshooting

- If the live demo fails to load, check for missing dependencies or server issues.
- Use the static fallback as needed to keep the demo on track.

---

## Pro Tips for Presenters
- Keep your language conversational and avoid jargon.
- Pause after each step to check in with the audience.
- If someone asks a technical question, relate it back to something familiar (e.g., "Think of the AI as a very fast, very smart analyst who never gets tired.")
- If you get stuck, narrate your thought process and show how you recover.
- Remind the audience: "You don’t need to know code to follow this — the magic is in the prompts and the process."

---

## Quick Reference
- **Prompt files are for the audience and the AI — they’re written to be easy to follow and copy-paste.**
- **This presenter file is just for you — keep it handy during the demo!**
- **README** has a checklist, troubleshooting, and more details if you need them.
