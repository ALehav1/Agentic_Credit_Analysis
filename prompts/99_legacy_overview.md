Step 99: Legacy Overview (Reference Only)

**Prompt Objective:**
Preserve the original, comprehensive prompt and build notes for historical reference and audit.

**Instructions:**
This file is NOT part of the main workflow. Use it only to:
- Show the audience how the project started and evolved.
- Compare the legacy monolithic approach to the new modular workflow.
- Audit or recover any original requirements or design notes.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Do NOT use this file as a prompt for building or running the app.
- If you need to recover legacy content, copy only what is needed—do not overwrite modular steps.

# Legacy Prompt Overview (Reference Only)

> **NOTE:** This file is for historical reference and audit only. Do **not** use it as a prompt for building or running the app.

## Objective

Preserve the original, comprehensive prompt and build notes for historical reference and audit.

## When to Use This File

- To show the audience how the project started and evolved.
- To compare the legacy monolithic approach to the new modular workflow.
- To audit or recover any original requirements or design notes.

## Instructions

- Do **not** use this file as a prompt for the main workflow.
- If you need to recover legacy content, copy only what is needed—do not overwrite modular steps.
- For current steps, always refer to the modular prompt files (01_intro_and_context.md, 02_generate_credit_analysis.md, etc.).

## Troubleshooting & Demo Safety

- If you accidentally reference this file in a live demo, clarify its historical purpose and redirect to the appropriate modular file.

*For the current workflow, always use the modular prompt files. For project structure and logic flow, see README.md.*

I want a front end that:
- Renders the **entire** content of my markdown file (`credit_analysis.md`) as collapsible, navigable panels.
- Sidebar navigation links to every section/subsection; sidebar is always vertical/sticky on desktop, scrollable if needed.
- Highlights only key metrics, key phrases, and key insights—those most important for a fast-scanning reader—using an **explicit, curated list** (no single-word or regex highlights). Highlighting should serve as a visual guide to the most critical content for decision-makers or analysts scanning quickly.
- All CSS/JS is referenced relatively, with clear documentation and error logs.
- The UI is modern, readable, and easy to audit/extend.

### Original Requirements (Pre-Agentic Approach)

 
- **Manual Data Entry:** Analyst manually inputs company name, ticker, and potentially uploads financials.
- **Static Templates:** Analysis structure based on fixed templates.
- **Limited Scope:** Focused primarily on quantitative metrics from filings.
- **Manual Report Generation:** Analyst writes the narrative and formats the final report (Word/PDF).
- **Time Consuming:** Process could take hours or days depending on complexity.

### Transition to Agentic Workflow
