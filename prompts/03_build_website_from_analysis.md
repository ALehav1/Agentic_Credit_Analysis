### Instructions for the Coding Agent

 

- Take the markdown output from the previous step as input.
- Render the content as collapsible, navigable panels (matching the current app's UX).
- Use a clean, professional color palette (white, dark blue, light gray).
- Ensure the site is mobile-friendly and accessible.
- Sidebar navigation links to every section/subsection; sidebar is always vertical/sticky on desktop, scrollable if needed.
- Each section/subsection is a collapsible card/panel with subtle shadows or borders for separation and depth.
- Sidebar navigation is fully interactive and highlights the active section as the user scrolls.
- Add gentle hover effects to navigation links and section headers for interactivity.
- Implement smooth scroll-to-section animation when navigation links are clicked.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

 

- If you don’t see the content, check that the files are present and the server is running.
- If navigation isn’t working, try refreshing the page or check for typos.
- If you get stuck, ask for help or check the README troubleshooting section.
